**30 Days of Udacity Challenge**

This challenge was started by me on 29th January 2020 and i aim to follow it every day and write whatever i learnt in this repo and make it available as Open Source for everyone to be able to see whatever mess I have made during this challenge.

Day 1 - 29th January - 

Completed a exercise of deploying an Edge Application and started my Lesson Three in Challenge Course Provided by Intel. I wasnt able to code exactly as there was a problem on Udacity's end so I just viewed the video after the exercise and eagerly waiting for the issue to resolve
