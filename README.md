**30 Days of Udacity Challenge**

This challenge was started by me on 29th January 2020 and i aim to follow it every day and write whatever i learnt in this repo and make it available as Open Source for everyone to be able to see whatever mess I have made during this challenge.

Day 1 - 29th January - 

Completed a exercise of deploying an Edge Application and started my Lesson Three in Challenge Course Provided by Intel. I wasnt able to code exactly as there was a problem on Udacity's end so I just viewed the video after the exercise and eagerly waiting for the issue to resolve

Day 2 - 30th January - 

Was again trying to Code the exercise which i previously skipped due to some technical difficulties and was trying to get my hands dirty on the online session. I looked through the documentation but to no avail and spent quite a while reading about openvino and model optimizer and working about all things openvino. I wasnt able to complete the challenge then also. Atlast i skipped the challenge and saw the solution video and understood how the working of things goes on in the lab.

Day 3 - 31st January-

I was fully prepared to take on the challenge but wasnt able to do so in my first attempt and had to watch the tutorial again to understand again what to do. I then followed tutors step and was able to complete the whole first step as he trained but wanted to the next two steps on my own. I tried on as the tutor suggested to look for keys in the dictionary object so as to gain knowledge about what that data structure holds and was able to do it successfully though i had the wrong np function called and had to watch the solution video again to solve but atlast the final step of the challenge was easy for me and i was able to do it without any issues. Started with lesson 3 and watched a few videos about model optimizer. Read about documentation about how to convert a tensorflow model into IR and will be doing it tomorrow.
